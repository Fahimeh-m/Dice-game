The "Game of Dice" is a game where 2 players roll a 6 faced dice in a round-robin fashion. Each time a player rolls the dice their points increase by the number (1 to 6) achieved by the roll. As soon as a player accumulates M points they complete the game and are assigned a rank. Another player continue to play the game till they accumulate at least M points.

 -Rules of the game

The order in which the users roll the dice is decided randomly at the start of the game.
If a player rolls the value "6" then they immediately get another chance to roll again and move ahead in the game.
If a player rolls the value "1"  then they are forced to skip their next turn as a penalty.
